Task
In a single toss of 2 fair (evenly-weighted) six-sided dice, find the probability that the values rolled by each die will be different and the two dice have a sum of 6.

a) 1 / 9
b) 1 / 6
c) 2 / 3
d) 5 / 6

Sol:

given 2 dice - A and B
sample space of A dice: {1,2,3,4,5,6}
sample space of B dice:{1,2,3,4,5,6}
When 2 dices are rolled, we get 36 (6*6) possibilities.
Out of which, 
A B sum sum==6(distinct)
1 5 6 true
2 4 6 true
4 3 6 true
5 1 6 true

so, out of 36 possibilites, only 4 possibilites are true.

P(sum(2 dices distinct)==6)=4/36=1/9
