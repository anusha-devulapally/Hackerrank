Task
Suppose a family has 2 children, one of which is a boy. What is the probability that both children are boys?

a) 1 / 3
b) 1 / 2
c) 2 / 3
d) 1 / 9

sol:
if family has 2 children- there are 4 possibilites
BB, GG, BG, GB
in which 3 (BB,BG,GB) satisfies the condition that one of the child is a boy.
In these 3 only 1 possibility for having both boys.
so, probability is 1/3
