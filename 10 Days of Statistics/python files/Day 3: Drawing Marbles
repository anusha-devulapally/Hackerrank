A bag contains 3 red marbles and 4 blue marbles. 
Then, 2 marbles are drawn from the bag, at random, without replacement. 
If the first marble drawn is red, what is the probability that the second marble is blue?

1) 1 / 12
2) 7 / 12
3) 1 / 6
4) 2 / 3

sol:
as the first ball is red, probability is 3/7
there are 2 possibilities for second ball, it can be red (2/6) or it can be blue(4/6)

So, probability of second marble being blue= ((3/7)*(4/6))/((3/7)*(4/6)+(3/7)*(2/6))
                                           = 2/3
